App Iâ€™d like to build: I want to design an app that helps people focus and avoid distractions using the Pomodoro technique. The app will use a timer to break work into 25-minute focus sessions followed by short breaks. This makes it easier to get started on tasks, especially when you're not feeling motivated. The app would also include optional white noise to help users concentrate. One important feature will be the ability to block distracting apps, similar to what ScreenZen does, so users can stay on task. The goal is to create a straightforward tool that makes it easier to sit down, start working, and stay focused.

Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
